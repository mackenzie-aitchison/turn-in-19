        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Forte is a music discovery app that helps music lovers find new music to listen to. This is done by
          presenting them with a preview of a song and the option to choose to like or dislike the song.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The idea of Forte came from the problem user's recommendations on listening apps often do not reflect their
          personal tastes and users have to discover new music on their own.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The solution to this founded the idea for Forte. Forte is an app that could help users find new music quickly
          and efficiently while evolving to the fast paced environment that we live in today.</p>
